  "content": "    In early 2021, GameStop (GME), a struggling video game retailer, became the epicenter of a financial storm. A Reddit forum, WallStreetBets, orchestrated a massive short squeeze. Hedge funds had heavily shorted GME, betting its stock would fall. Retail investors countered by buying en masse, driving the price from under $20 to over $400 in weeks. This forced short sellers to cover positions at massive losses. Melvin Capital lost billions and required a bailout. The event highlighted the democratization of trading via platforms like Robinhood. Trading halts triggered regulatory scrutiny. Retail investors questioned Wall Street’s fairness, while institutions faced margin calls. The SEC investigated potential market manipulation. It sparked debates on gamification of trading and order flow payments. The incident showcased social media’s influence on capital markets. It also raised concerns about volatility and market infrastructure.For many, it was a generational statement against institutional dominance. GME’s fundamentals didn’t justify the surge, but sentiment outweighed valuation. Congress held hearings, including testimonies from Robinhood’s CEO and Reddit users. ",
