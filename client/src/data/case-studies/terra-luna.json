  "excerpt": "The collapse of Terra Luna and its algorithmic stablecoin UST represents one of the most dramatic failures in cryptocurrency history, wiping out $60 billion in value.",
  "content": "In 2022, the Terra ecosystem experienced one of crypto’s most catastrophic failures. Terra’s UST was an algorithmic stablecoin designed to maintain a $1 peg through arbitrage with its sister token, LUNA.  When UST depegged in May, panic selling began. The algorithm failed to stabilize the price, leading to hyperinflation of LUNA. Over $40 billion in market value vanished within days. Investors across DeFi platforms suffered losses. Anchor Protocol, which promised 20% yields, was heavily reliant on UST, exacerbating the collapse.  Do Kwon, Terra’s founder, faced legal scrutiny and went into hiding. The crash sent shockwaves through the crypto market, wiping out trust in algorithmic stablecoins. Regulatory agencies worldwide took note. Many compared it to a DeFi version of a bank run. It underscored the fragility of protocols without asset backing. The event caused a chain reaction, contributing to failures at Celsius, Voyager, and Three Arrows Capital. The crypto winter deepened, and institutional interest cooled. Calls for stablecoin regulation intensified.",
