  "content": "A The 2008 financial crisis was ignited by a widespread failure in the US housing market. Lenders issued subprime mortgages to borrowers with poor credit histories, betting that rising home prices would protect them from defaults. Financial institutions repackaged these risky loans into complex derivatives like mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). As housing prices fell, borrowers defaulted en masse, rendering these securities worthless. Major institutions like Lehman Brothers collapsed, triggering global panic. AIG required a $182 billion bailout due to its exposure via credit default swaps. Interbank lending froze, equity markets plummeted, and liquidity evaporated. Central banks worldwide slashed rates and introduced stimulus measures. The U.S. government enacted TARP to stabilize banks. The crisis exposed flaws in risk management, oversight, and financial engineering. It led to the Dodd-Frank Act and Basel III regulations. The ripple effects persisted for years, with high unemployment and slow recovery. Trust in financial institutions eroded. Global trade shrank, and emerging markets were hit by capital outflows.",
